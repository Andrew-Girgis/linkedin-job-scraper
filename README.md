## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Andrew-Girgis/linkedin-job-scraper
   cd linkedin-job-scraper
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Chrome WebDriver**
   The system uses `webdriver-manager` to automatically download and manage ChromeDriver.

4. **Set up MongoDB**
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account or set up a local MongoDB instance
   - Note your connection URI for configuration

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# LinkedIn Credentials (required for authenticated scraping)
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/

# OpenAI API (for LLM skill extraction)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## 📖 Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### 1. Scrape Individual URLs
```bash
# Scrape specific job URLs
python main.py https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1234567890/

# Scrape multiple URLs
python main.py \
  https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1234567890/ \
  https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=9876543210
```

#### 2. Batch Processing
```bash
# Add URLs to jobs_to_scrape.txt (one per line)
echo "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1234567890/" >> jobs_to_scrape.txt

# Run scraper
python main.py
```

#### 3. Test Single Job
```bash
python test.py
```

### Browser Extension

1. **Load the Extension**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `browser_extension` folder

2. **Start the Webhook Server**
   ```bash
   python webhook_server.py
   ```
   Server will run on `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Use the Extension**
   - Navigate to any LinkedIn job page
   - Click the extension icon
   - Click "Save this job" to add it to the processing queue
   - Monitor progress in the extension popup

### Webhook Server

The webhook server provides real-time job processing with a queue system:

```bash
python webhook_server.py
```

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /webhook` - Add job URL to processing queue
- `GET /status` - Get current processing statistics
- `GET /` - Health check

### Jupyter Notebook

Explore and analyze scraped data using the included Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook li_scraper.ipynb
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`main.py`** - CLI orchestrator for batch job scraping
2. **`scraper.py`** - Core scraping logic with Selenium WebDriver
3. **`db.py`** - MongoDB integration and data persistence
4. **`cheap_extract.py`** - Fast regex/NLP-based data extraction
5. **`llm_extract.py`** - OpenAI GPT-powered skill extraction
6. **`post_process.py`** - Data cleaning and normalization
7. **`webhook_server.py`** - Flask-based webhook server
8. **`site_converter.py`** - URL conversion utilities
9. **Browser Extension** - Chrome extension for seamless job saving

### Data Flow

```
LinkedIn URL → URL Conversion → Selenium Scraping → Cheap Extraction → 
LLM Enhancement → Post Processing → MongoDB Storage
```

### Extraction Pipeline

1. **Initial Scraping**: Uses `linkedin-scraper` library with Selenium
2. **Cheap Extraction**: Fast regex-based extraction of:
   - Employment type (full-time, part-time, contract, etc.)
   - Workplace type (remote, hybrid, on-site)
   - Degree requirements
   - Benefits
   - Basic skills
3. **LLM Enhancement**: OpenAI GPT extracts required skills if cheap extraction fails
4. **Post Processing**: 
   - Location parsing (city, province/state)
   - Date normalization
   - Salary currency detection
   - Seniority level inference
